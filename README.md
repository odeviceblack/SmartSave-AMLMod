# **SmartSave – Automatic Save Mod**

## **📌 What SmartSave Does**

* Adds an **AutoSave Interval** option directly inside the game’s Mods settings menu
* Saves the game automatically after a configurable time period
* Works quietly in the background while you play
* Prevents progress loss during missions, exploration or long play sessions
* Fully integrated into the existing save system — no custom formats, no manual steps

## **🎮 Player Experience**

Once configured, SmartSave takes care of everything.
Just choose an interval (e.g., *10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes*, etc.) and the game will automatically create save points while you enjoy the gameplay normally.

There are no pop-ups, no extra screens, and no interruptions — the game continues running as usual.
